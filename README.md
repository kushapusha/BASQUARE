# BASQUARE Task

First and Second tasks are located in the same Angular project BASQUARE.

1. For the First task I created an angular component without JS usage which is called - header.component. 

2. Second task you can find in the main.component. 

3. For me, Clean Code means that every person who reads those code - will understand what functionality it has. For example, variables has to be named as clear as it could be, using of different patterns also would be a good idea and no dublicated code. For structural side of Clean Code we can use ESLint or TSLint.

4.Unfortunately, I havent had any complited project, but I was working in cool team, which decided to implement their idea in life. It was self-educational platform for different institutions. Of course, its not a brand new thing, but for me it was something huge and special. I hope it will go on and one day we will see those project in use.

5. Currently, I learn and work with JS - object oriented language, basically with Angular framework which is perfectly fit for all challenges of the project, but maybe in future, I will consider to learn functional and decklarative programming. I have just general knowledge of Functional Programming and I know, that it is faster, but it doesnt have those principles which are available in OOP. Any programming concept is pretty good for solving particular aspects, so we should investigate what we need more.

6. Oh, I have seen really cool CSS recently. The main idea was that page has bright background with gradient and there is some photo and when you scroll down the page, background doesnt move, but the photo start to dublicate itself and move those copies to the left. Every scroll - one move to the left. Also there is some text and it move standardly, but due to the fact that background behavior is unusual it makes text direction weird too. In general it looks good.
